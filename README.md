# Personal Finance and Budget Tracker

Nowadays, it can be very time-consuming and confusing to keep track of one's personal finances and budget goals, as people often have multiple accounts (bank accounts, cash, etc.) scattered across various platforms. Without a unified view, it becomes complicated to visualize spending habits, set realistic financial targets, and seek timely advice to stay on top of spending goals.

To address these challenges, our project offers an intuitive platform that brings all the financial information together such as monitoring user's budget in real time and receive AI-powered recommendations tailored to their financial habits. Users can easily monitor their expenses, set and track spending goals, and receive personalized recommendations to improve their financial health while being able to seek for spending advice. Our key features include a secure login system, a central dashboard with a monthly overview, a detailed history of transactions, visual spending analysis through charts, and a personalised AI recommendation chat. We believe real time analytics into managing personal finances can be simpler and more transparent in order to achieve users' long term financial objectives. Moreover, users will also be able to customize and set their spending goals along with alerts that reminds users to be cautious with their spending habits. Our high level goal is to make personal finance management accessible and proactive providing users the motivation they need to build a healthier financial habit and achieve their long term goals.
